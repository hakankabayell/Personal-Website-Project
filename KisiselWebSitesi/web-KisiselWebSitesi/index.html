            <h2>Computer Engineering | Web Developer</h2>
            <p>As a computer engineering student, I have to say that I really enjoy using computer during doing my researches, coding and executing an algorithm, spending time for my pleasures such as watching a movie. As a member of a team, I am a person who can work properly in the team and communicate with teammates well. Desire of mine to learn something new about my department has been growing as time goes on so I can clearly say that I am giving my best all the time to improve myself. Outside of my work life, I love doing gym, playing some games to improve my English, and socializing with other people.</p>
